    As part of the Clay-Wolkin Fellowship at Harvey Mudd College (led by Professor David Harris), I am developing a comprehensive open-source RISC-V architectural functional verification suite that will become the 
    official version 4.0 of the RISC-V Architectural Verification Test Suite for RISC-V International. </p></p>

    This work originally began as an effort to fully verify the CORE-V Wally processor — an open-source RISC-V RV64GC/RV32GC core built by the Clay-Wolkin Fellowship — 
    to advance it to Technology Readiness Level 5. 
    Due to its robust and comprehensive testing, the suite has now been approved as the official version 4.0 of the RISC-V Architectural Verification Test 
    Suite. My responsibilities include developing complete test suites — including test plans, coverpoints, and tests — that ensure conformance to the RISC-V ISA, 
    integrating them into the Architectural Compatibility Test (ACT) framework, and developing signature checking and self-checking mechanisms.
   </p></p>  Successful completion and passing of the ACT suite is a foundational step toward gaining permission to use the “RISC-V Compatible” 
    trademark for processor profiles and extensions.

      The development of this Test Suite was primarily undertaken as a Clinic project at Harvey Mudd College, in collaboration with 10xEngineers and 
      under the guidance of Professor David Harris. This capstone project involves teams of six students working on real-world industry challenges.</p> 
      <p>Most students in the clinic were also part of the Clay-Wolkin fellowship and have continue working on the development of the tests and the 
        integration into ACT as <strong style="color: yellow;"> summer research.</strong>  </p>

          <!-- In parallel, I designed and tested an AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle)
      with pressure, salinity, turbidity, and depth sensors using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
    
    
      The AUV system achieved 98% data accuracy with real-time sensor communication and onboard processing.
      I also collaborated on calibration procedures and implemented data logging protocols for field testing.-->
