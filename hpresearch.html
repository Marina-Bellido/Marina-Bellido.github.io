    <h1> RESIST (Re-envisioning Energy System Infrastructure and Storage Technology) Lab </h1>
    <h2><strong>Reducing Costs for Space- and Water-Heating in Multifamily Buildings</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May 2024 - July 2024</p>
    <p>            
      As part of a multi-institution research initiative led by Prof. Helmns and supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, 
      I contributed to the modeling and validation of a novel combined space and water heating system. The project tackles critical 
      cost and performance barriers to electrified heating by integrating an air-to-water heat pump with phase change material thermal 
      energy storage (PCM TES) — allowing efficient heating during off-peak, renewable-heavy grid periods.     

    <li> Modeled and validated a field-demonstrated heat pump + PCM TES system using Modelica, comparing simulations with live performance
      data to identify and resolve discrepancies. </li>
      <p> <li>Extended the validated model to scalable use cases for multifamily residential buildings in cold climates using Model-Based Design.</li> </p> 
      <p> <li>Explored thermal system design and controls to enhance energy flexibility and efficiency through heat pump integration with thermal storage. </li>  </p> 
      <p> <li>Contributed to a research paper under review for publication with the U.S Department of Energy.</li> </p> 

    This work enables building-scale decarbonization by simulating complex thermal interactions before deployment — significantly reducing development time and cost.

          <!-- In parallel, I designed and tested an AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle)
      with pressure, salinity, turbidity, and depth sensors using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
    
    
      The AUV system achieved 98% data accuracy with real-time sensor communication and onboard processing.
      I also collaborated on calibration procedures and implemented data logging protocols for field testing.-->
